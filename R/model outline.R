#Can you read that?
# resistance = 5
# Given data set
# landscape
# one metapopulation
# individuals move around according to resistance values ofr XXX generations
# e.g. pairwise FSt between subpopulations


#### ABC landscape genetics

#0. select values of  parameters (resistance) [=resABC] [from prior]
#1. Initiate a landscape with resABC to calculate a distance matrix
#2. run our model 
#3. compare our output (summary statistic e.g. pairwise Fst) and check how close it is to the "real" value
#4. mode of distribution

#run this 100000x 


#Scenarios?
# continuous vs discrete landscapes
# local barriers adding
# small scale versus larger scale?
# sample size (# subpopulations, how strong is the restistance, # loci)
# different sizes subpopulations
# compare landscape resistance algorithm 
# dispersal, population density

#How to decide? 
#1. Read, find simulation literature
#2. Predict some relationships
#3. do some test runs

#4. chosen: popgenreport
#5. Todo: convert into parallel, 
#         test different summary statistics
#         decide on scenarios
